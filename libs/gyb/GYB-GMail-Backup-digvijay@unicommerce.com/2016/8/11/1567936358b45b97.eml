The City Of Archers
Back in human history there used to exist a city known as Genon City .It
was always under threat from the enemies but it had the best archers in the
world ever known to protect it.
To prepare for battle all archers performed similar actions. First go to
wamboo-a warehouse- to collect arrows. Number of arrows one gets is the
sequence number in which he arrives, first one gets 1, second 2 and so on.
No two archers arrive at the same time.

Every archer then puts the arrows inside marina - a machine - which first
cleans the arrow,
then sharpens and finally colour=E2=80=99s it but every 5th arrows that is =
cleaned
get broken ,so machine replaces it with a special arrow which is equivalent
to 2 normal arrows.

At the battle fort they stand in same sequence as they arrived at warehouse
and fire one by one starting with first. Far away are enemies. It takes 2n
arrow to kill an enemy, first 2, and second 4, third 6 and so on. Every 7th
arrow fired misses the enemy which increases that enemy=E2=80=99s strength =
and it
requires 2 more arrows now to get killed ,Archers is not aware of this.

Before every arrow shot, an archerknows how many enemies are already killed
or semi killed (shot with few arrows before). So he calculates arrows for
killing next enemy .An archerleaves whenever he doesn't have enough arrows
to kill the enemy and nextarchers come to action.

A battle is won if all the enemies are killed with 0 or more arrows
remaining.
Write an application which models the above situation. First input to the
application should be number of archers and the second input should be
number of enemies.

Number of Archer 4
