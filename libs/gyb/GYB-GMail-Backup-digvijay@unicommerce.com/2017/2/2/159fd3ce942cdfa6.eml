Hi Sir,
We have updated the last column of the settlement invoices page from
"status on channel" to "other info".
Earlier it used to represent the payment reason for which the transaction
is made (Like Refund, Return, MarketPlaceFee). But since Flipkart doesn't
give any such reason in its sheet (we mapped it with order status as of
now, which resulted in duplicate invoices), we have to put in invoice code
in that field to maintain uniqueness of invoices. Hence renamed the column
to "other info".

Thanks
